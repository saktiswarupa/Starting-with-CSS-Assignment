<div class="internal">Wikipedia is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization 
    that also hosts a range of other projects.</div>
<div class="external">A number of organizations within the Wikimedia movement including the Wikimedia Foundation publish official mobile apps for mobile access to Wikipedia. All are available via the appropriate app store (e.g. Google Play, App Store, Microsoft Store, F-Droid). They can also be downloaded independently of any third-party store, from the Wikimedia Foundation's releases 
    website, which also keeps old and beta versions.</div>
<div style="color: blueviolet;" class="inline__internal">Independent developers have also released many unofficial apps for reading Wikipedia articles. Some apps load content from the Wikipedia site and process it; other apps use the MediaWiki API.
     Some only display Wikipedia content, usually omitting some features such as categories and talk pages. Some allow editing.</div>
